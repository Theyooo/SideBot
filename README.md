# SideBot

This is a discord bot that will basically do coin flips.
The main goal was to help players choose side in games such as LoL, Chess, CSGO etc.

# Discord modules 

Import Discord node modules with 

$ npm install discord.js

then initialize it in the folder that you want with 

$ npm init 

to start the bot, it's as easy as : 

$ node main.js

OR 

After cloning, just do :

$ npm install 

# Needs

To make it work you'll need a token and some other things. 
The best I can do is to put the link of the video I began with : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_sD9udZnCk 
From now it's all about reading discord.js documentation.
Good luck and have fun tossing coins.
